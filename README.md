# A Game of Menagerie
This is a game of Menagerie built in C++ using SFML/Graphics.

#### This was our Programming Fundamentals final project for our first semester of bachelor's in Data Science at NUCES FAST. Any updates after are mentioned, and we have tried our best to maintain the project to its original vision and restraints. That is why there are no updates changing the core mechanics — or functionality — only what was allowed to us at the time is what is used.

<h2> How to use: </h2>
<li> Clone repository.
<li> Use makefile to build the game
<li> Run using Ubuntu's terminal or Windows Subsystem For Linux.

<h2> Pre-requisites: </h2>
<li> G++ Compiler</li>
<li> A Linux terminal environment (WSL works too)</li>
<li> SFML (libsfml-dev) </li>
<li> Makefile (or alternatively, run the four commands in the makefile) </li>
