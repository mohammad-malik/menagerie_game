# A Game of Menagerie
This is a game of Menagerie built in C++ using SFML/Graphics.

#### This was made as the Programming Fundamentals final project for my first semester of bachelors. Any updates after are mentioned, and I have tried my best to maintain the project to its original vision and restraints

<li> Clone repository.
